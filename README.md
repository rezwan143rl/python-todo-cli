# 📝 To-Do List (Python CLI Project)

A simple command-line to-do list application built using basic Python concepts like file handling, loops, and conditionals. This is my first project after learning core Python — it will be updated as I learn more!

---

## 📌 Features

- Add a new task
- View all tasks
- Mark tasks as completed

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.x).
2. Run the script:

```bash
python todo.py
Follow the prompts:

Type 1 to add a task

Type 2 to mark a task as completed

Type 3 to view all tasks

📂 How It Works
Tasks are stored in a plain text file named tasks.txt

When you add or update a task, the file is modified directly

Completed tasks get a (completed) tag

📈 What's Next
This is a beginner version. I'm planning to:

 Add a delete task option

 Improve user interface

 Switch to OOP structure

 Use JSON for better data storage

 Add task numbering for easier use

 Build a GUI or web version in the future
